## Project Overview

This project analyzes the performance of different matrix multiplication implementations (MPI, OpenMPI, and Hybrid) by extracting execution times from log files and calculating speedup and efficiency metrics.

## Data

The data used in this project is extracted from log files generated by running matrix multiplication programs with varying matrix sizes and core numbers. The extracted data includes:

- Folder: The folder the log file originated from (e.g., `parallel_mpi/logs`).
- Log File: The name of the log file.
- Matrix Size: The size of the matrices used in the multiplication.
- Core Number: The number of cores used for the execution.
- Seconds: The execution time in seconds extracted from the log file.

The extracted data is stored in pandas DataFrames: `extracted_data_df_mpi`, `extracted_data_df_openmpi`, `extracted_data_df_serial`, and `extracted_data_df_hybrid`. These DataFrames are then combined into a single DataFrame `extracted_data_df`.

## Analysis and Visualization

The project calculates the speedup and efficiency for each implementation (MPI, OpenMPI, and Hybrid) based on the serial execution times.

- **Speedup**: The ratio of the execution time of the serial implementation to the execution time of the parallel implementation.
- **Efficiency**: The speedup divided by the number of cores.

The speedup and efficiency are then visualized using line plots, showing the performance metrics against the number of cores for different matrix sizes. The plots are avalaible in the Jupyter Notebook and also in the report.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository: `!git clone https://github.com/saadrza/HPC_uni_tn_2025.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `os.chdir('/content/HPC_uni_tn_2025/HPC_uni_tn_2025')`
3. Run the notebook cells to extract data, calculate metrics, and generate visualizations.
